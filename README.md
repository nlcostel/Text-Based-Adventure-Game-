# Text-Based-Adventure-Game-

A branching path, interactive story written in Python. 

Welcome to the text-based-adventure-game, a fully interactive narrative experience built entirely in Python. This project demonstrates core programming skills including branching logic, input handling, modular design, user-driven gameplay and structured documentation. 

Players explore a scripted world, make decisions, and navigate multiple possible story outcomes. This project is designed as part of a portfolio showcase for Data Analytics, Engineering, and Software Logic. 

# Features:

Interactive branching storyline

Multiple decision paths and endings

Replayable gameplay

Clean menu/navigation structure

Input validation & user guidance

Simple, readable Python code

Comprehensive documentation
